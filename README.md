This is a program that does various things to demonstrate looping.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Building:
  Windows:
    Run MSbuild or use Visual Studio to build.
  Linux:
    Mono might work? Still working on that.
  Mac OS:
    There is currently no building instructions for Mac OSx
  Other *nix
    Good Luck.
